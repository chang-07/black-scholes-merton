## Functions
Given the 5 main parameters of the Black-Scholes-Merton Model (assuming Dividends = 0%) — `Spot Price (S)`, `Strike Price (K)`, `Risk-Free Rate (R)`, `Time to Maturity (T)`, and `Annualized Volatility (Σ)` — outputs the put price and call price options. 

Given parameters for max/min annualized volatility and max/min call price, outputs two heatmaps that display the call price and put price values based on the grid.
